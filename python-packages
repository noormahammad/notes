SCILAB Image processing toolbox--> http://siptoolbox.sourceforge.net/


For advanced image processing, you will need one or several of the following packages:

PyGame is needed for video and sound previews
(not relevant if you intend to work with MoviePy on a server but essential for advanced video editing by hand).

The Python Imaging Library (PIL) or, even better, its branch Pillow.
Scipy (for tracking, segmenting, etc.) can be used to resize video clips if PIL and OpenCV are not installed.
Scikit Image may be needed for some advanced image manipulation.
OpenCV 2.4.6 or a more recent version (one that provides the package cv2) may be needed for some advanced image manipulation.
Matplotlib
ImageMagick is not strictly required, but needed if you want to incorporate texts. It can also be used as a backend for GIFs, 
though you can also create GIFs with MoviePy without ImageMagick.
