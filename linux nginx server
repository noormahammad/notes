nginx is used as front end http web server and also as http reverse proxy server. It can also be used as Load balancer, content cache server. 
it is also used a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server. it can handle thousands of requests per second and offers high availability and
scalability to millions of users. 

Here is How to use nginx as a reverse proxy to be able to host multiple apps on different ports on a single linux vm and serve them
with different domains:

1. login to linux vm (eithe ssh into it or use putty)
2. run command "sudo apt-get update" (brings all packages on linux upto date)
3. run command "sudo apt-get install nginx" (install nginx package)
4. run command "cd /etc/nginx" and "ls" to see "sites-availabe" and "sites-enabled" folders
5. when you put configuration file in "sites-available" directory, it will not be available when nginx is reloaded. so, we need to create
   a symbolic link for config file in sites-available directory into "sites-enabled" directory.
