nginx is used as front end http web server and also as http reverse proxy server. It can also be used as Load balancer, content cache server. 
it is also used a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server. it can handle thousands of requests per second and offers high availability and
scalability to millions of users. 

Here is How to use nginx as a reverse proxy to be able to host multiple apps on different ports on a single linux vm and serve them
with different domains:

1. login to linux vm (eithe ssh into it or use putty) and run following commands
2. $ sudo apt-get update (brings all packages on linux upto date)
3. $ sudo apt-get install nginx (install nginx package)
4. $ cd /etc/nginx ("ls" to see "sites-availabe" and "sites-enabled" folders)
5. $ cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
6. $ sudo rm default (remove default config file)
7. $ sudo vim myconfig (create a new config file)
8. insert following text in myconfig file 
   server {
            listen 80; 
            location / {
               proxy_pass "http://127.0.0.1"
               }
           }
9. press Esc and :wq and enter to save and exit the file 
10. When you put configuration file in "sites-available" directory, the new changes will not go into effect when nginx is reloaded. 
   so, we need to create a symbolic link (symlink) for config file in sites-available directory into "sites-enabled" directory. 
   Type the following command to cretae symlink: 
   $ sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/myconfig /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myconfig
   (this creates a soft symlink in sites-enabled directory)
